# Homework 4 - Code Quiz - Michael Mallon

## What I did

This week’s homework assignment challenged me by demanding a more advanced understanding of JS functions, APIs, and local storage. I built a coding quiz by building blank sections in HTML then filling them with data in JavaScript. I also used CSS styles to make the sections visible and hidden

The JavaScript I wrote stores the quiz data in three arrays: questions, answers and an answer key. When questions are presented the app will compare the chosen answer to the answer key. If correct, the next question is displayed. If incorrect, 10 seconds is deducted from the time and the next question is displayed. 

### Motivation:
This was by far the most challenged I have felt in the Coding Bootcamp program. This was the first time where I used local storage and manipulated CSS to hide and show different HTML/ JavaScript elements. The motivation to learn how to create a multi-page application was fulfilled… after lots of time spent debugging

### Problems I solved:
    * Created several buttons that changed their text values and reacted when pushed
    * Used JavaScript to change the CSS class used for HTML elements
    * Used local storage to set and get array values
